This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the application with:

```bash
yarn // npm install
yarn dev // npm run start
```

## About The Development Process

In order to build this application quickly to showcase my skills, I've done the following:

- Designed in a peace of paper the application architecture
- Designed in a peace of paper the mockup of this application
- Opened Figma and Started Designing a which wireframe
- Started Creating Tables and Relations in MySQL Database
- Started Coding the Back-end
- Started Coding the Front-end
